Some features :-
1. Fully responsive and interactive UI
2. Mark items as favourites
3. Searching possible for a particular property by name or country
4. Custom Implemented Multiple Image Viewer with caching and compression using compressor-js for better User Experience as image size is very big and displaying it uses a lot of resource which results in laggy experience. This was by far the most difficult task in this challenge.
5. Full screen view for each image.
6. Pagination to navigate through the properties
7. pageLimit added in config.json (configurable) which is default to 16 per page.
